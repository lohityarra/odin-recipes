        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>12 slices home-style white bread, cut into 1-inch cubes, divided</li>
            <li>2 (8 ounce) packages cold cream cheese, cut into 1-inch cubes</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups sliced fresh strawberries</li>
            <li>2 cups half-and-half
            <li>12 large eggs</li>
            <li>⅓ cup pure maple syrup </li>
            
            Sauce:
            
            <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
            <li>1 cup sliced fresh strawberries</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Generously grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Arrange half the bread cubes in the prepared baking dish. Evenly distribute cream cheese cubes over the bread cube layer; sprinkle 1 1/2 cups sliced strawberries atop cream cheese layer. Layer the remaining bread cubes over strawberry layer.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Pour half-and-half into a blender; pulse for a few seconds. Blend eggs into half-and-half until fully incorporated. Add maple syrup and blend until smooth. Pour mixture evenly over bread mixture. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and refrigerate 8 hours or overnight.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Remove baking dish from refrigerator 45 minutes before baking.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <br>
            <li>Bake the covered casserole in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Remove aluminum foil and continue baking until French toast is puffed and golden brown, about 30 more minutes.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Stir sugar, water, and cornstarch together in a small saucepan. Cook, stirring occasionally, over medium heat until mixture has thickened, about 5 minutes. Mix in 1 cup sliced strawberries; cook and stir until strawberries have softened, about 10 minutes. Add butter; stir until melted. Serve hot over French toast.</li>
        </ol>
