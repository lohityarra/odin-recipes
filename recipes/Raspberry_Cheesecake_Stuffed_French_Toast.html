        <p>I came up with this recipe one morning while preparing breakfast for guests at my bed and breakfast. It became one of our most requested dishes and I later included it in our inn's cookbook! </p>
        
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup milk </li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vanilla extract </li>
            <li>1 cup white sugar </li>
            <li>2 tablespoons cinnamon </li>
            <li>4 eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>1 cup raspberry puree</li>
            <li>4 ounces cream cheese, softened</li>
            <li>1 loaf French bread, cut into 1 inch slices</li>
            <li>butter</li>
            <li>confectioners' sugar for dusting</li>
            <li>nutmeg, for topping </li>
            
           
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a bowl, whisk milk, vanilla, sugar, and cinnamon into the beaten eggs until well blended. Set aside. In a separate bowl, cream together raspberry puree and cream cheese until smooth. Make 'sandwiches' by cutting each slice of bread in half and spreading raspberry-cheese mixture in the center, then top with the other half.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Melt butter over medium heat in a large skillet or griddle. Dip bread into egg mixture, coating thoroughly. Cook until well-browned on both sides, about 5 minutes. Dust with confectioners' sugar and nutmeg. Serve immediately.</li>
            

        </ol>
